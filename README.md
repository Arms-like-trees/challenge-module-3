# Password Generator

## Finished Site Summary

I was wanting to make a site that would create a password after a series of prompts.  The password needed to be at least 8 characters long but no more that 128 as well as use a wide variety of characters that include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and special characters.  I also wanted to insure that from the prompts everything that I wanted in the password would be included as well as leave out what I had said to leave out.  While doing this I learned more of how to use the .push and .concat methods to add element from one array into an empty array.

The following is a link to the website [Password generator site] (https://arms-like-trees.github.io/challenge-module-3/)
